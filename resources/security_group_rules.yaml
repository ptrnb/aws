# Describe your VPC security groups
#
# Each IP Permissions list must contain:
#  - protocol
#  - from port
#  - to port
#  - source
#
#  'source' may be either a CIDR formatted
#  IP address representing a host, network 
#  or anywhere eg. 0.0.0.0/0
#
#  OR
#
#  the name of one of the other security
#  groups defined in this YAML file.
#  The actual security group ID will
#  be substitued at runtime
